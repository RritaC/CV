# CV Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive single-page portfolio website showcasing a comprehensive CV with smooth animations, interactive elements, and a clean, professional design.

## 📋 Project Overview

This is a fully responsive CV portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a unique design with smooth scroll animations, interactive galleries, and a modern UI that highlights achievements, experience, education, and skills in an engaging way.

## 🎯 Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- **Smooth Animations**: Scroll-based animations and transitions throughout
- **Interactive Gallery**: Lightbox gallery with keyboard navigation and mobile carousel
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean design with gradient backgrounds, card-based layouts, and professional styling
- **Navigation**: Sticky navigation bar with smooth scrolling and active section highlighting
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and ARIA labels for better accessibility

## 📑 Section Order (Optimized for Founder/Portfolio Version)

The website is organized in the following strategic order:

1. **Navigation Bar** - Sticky navigation with links to all sections
2. **Hero Section** (`#home`) - Introduction with name, tagline, stats, and profile photo
3. **Achievements Section** (`#achievements`) - Awards, hackathons, scholarships, and recognitions (starts strong with credibility)
4. **Experience Section** (`#experience`) - Work experience and professional roles (shows how achievements were earned)
5. **Projects Section** (`#projects`) - Showcase of projects and initiatives (tangible proof of capabilities)
6. **Education Section** (`#education`) - Timeline of educational achievements (supportive background)
7. **Certifications Section** (`#certifications`) - Certifications and trainings organized by category (validates expertise)
8. **Skills Section** (`#skills`) - Technical and professional skills with competencies (summary of capabilities)
9. **Gallery Section** (`#gallery`) - Visual gallery with lightbox functionality (personal, creative finish)
10. **Footer** - Contact information and social links

**Visual Dividers**: Subtle horizontal dividers separate the "Professional Journey" sections (Achievements → Experience → Projects) to create a cohesive narrative flow.
